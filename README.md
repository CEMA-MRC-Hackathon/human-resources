**Goal**

Sustainable investment for health workforce
(How to project recruitment model for healthcare workers based on evidence)/How to optimize the health workforce in kenya towards achieving UHC

Evidence to understand:
- Training
- Employment/Recruitment
- Retention 
- Capacity building
- Equipment

**Objectives**

Over the hackathon our objective is to: 
To create a proof-of-concept county-level dashboard, initially for a single disease: HIV, that combines 1) the burden of disease with 2) the healthcare human time-resources required to treat each case, to quantify the total time needed by cadre of healthworker, then compares this need to the current healthcare human time-resources available, to quantify the extent of current unmet needs. 

**Data requirements**

Health workforce data level 
- Private vs public
- Mapping epidemiological burden of disease vs health workforce specialists
- Mapping ratio health workforce vs patients
- Mapping ratio epidemiological burden of disease vs cadres
- Regional, counties, urban/rural
- Investment vs saving 

Pathway from training to becoming part of the workforce
- Production (come out of training), 
- Supply (want to work in Kenya, not migrated, moved out of field,staff mortality), 
- Demand (available jobs and places), 
- Need (provide best care requirements)

Longitudinal data
- Baseline data, monitoring and evaluation of intervention
- Continued data pipelines to have most up to date current outputs

**Outputs**
- Dashboard to provide perspective for financial projections and fiscal space
- Investment case that is evidence-based

**Models**
1. Staffing model: Will create HR needs based on standards
2. Staffing gaps : Will compare ideal requirements versus existing staffing to identify gaps
3. Interventions : This will explore actions, and their cost-effectiveness, required to fill the identified gaps

**Available data** 

Health workforce data 
- 47 counties
- Densities, demographics
- Distribution of different cadres
- Activity standards across different cadres (time per patient)
- Disease burden (by county, by cadre)
- Integrated Human Resource Information System (iHRIS)

**Implementation**
- Aligned with efforts from Presidential taskforce on HRH reforms

**Analytical Plan**

By the end of the week we plan to:
1. compile data on HIV burden by county (prevalence x population)
2. compile time time needed to treat each case by cadre
3. combine (1) with (2) to determine total time resources needed per county
4. collate human time resources available by county and cadre (=time resources available)
5. compare time resources available (4) vs need (3) to determine unmet needs
6. create dashboard
7. create data visualiations, including maps of (1-5)
8. decide on priority model extensions

**Data sources**
PLHIV ART catchment data https://naomi-spectrum.unaids.org/
Kenya population data https://naomi-spectrum.unaids.org/

By the end of Tuesday we aim to
- have collated all the data (1) (2) and (4) - Francis, Lilith
- get data into a tidy format for use in the model - John
- create a wireframe of the dashboard (Sabine, Jackie and George)
- Decide on priority next steps (Moses, Penina)

**Priority next steps**
1. HRH evidence-based Projections (Potential future trends e.g. global policy changes and other assumptions vs effects on health workforce supply and demand)
2. Add more diseases that could have current interventions like vaccines (epidemiological disease burden vs health workforce specialty, HRH time reduction vs policy intervention -vaccination)to the dashboard
3. Investment case (From the HRH gap established we estimate the resource need for the gap using unit cost for each cadre)
